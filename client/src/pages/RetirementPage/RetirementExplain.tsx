      <p className="text-[15px] mb-3">
        Our free calculator estimates your retirement nest egg based on your current retirement savings contributions and then calculates how it will stretch over your retirement in todayâ€™s dollars,
        taking inflation into account.

              saving 10% to 15% of your pretax income for retirement. When you enter a number in the monthly contribution field, the calculator will automatically translate that to a percentage of
              your income and display that figure below this field.

              Your monthly budget in retirement is how much you think youâ€™ll need each month to live comfortably throughout your retirement, before taxes. One way to estimate this is to look at your
              current spending and project how it might change in retirement.
