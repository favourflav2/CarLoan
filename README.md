# The Finance Calculator
- [The Finance Calculator](https://thefinancecalculator.org/)

# Description
This application is a calculator that uses future value, present value, cost of debt, and other equations to find how much something cost. You will be able to visually see how time and interest play a crucial part on the type of loans you choose and the type of investments you decide.

# Why
When I was in high school a friend recommended that I read Rich Dad Poor Dad, that book ended up compelling me to learn more about money and finance. As I started learning more and more about money, I started seeing a recurring problem. Whether it be social media, coworkers, and even my friends. A lot of people didn't fully understand the power of interest rates and time. Iâ€™ve had friends, family, and coworkers take out loans and or incur debt but do not know how their interest rate and term will cost them in the long run. 

I built this application so people can have a place where they can visually see the relationship between interest and time. They will be able to determine if that car loan and or mortgage is worth it, because they will be able to run the numbers. And ultimately also have the chance to see how much that loan will cost them over that period of time, and hopefully make a better informed decision.
